"
I represent block markup, indicated by '> ' at the beginning of a line. 
I'm like a preformatted in HTML or Pillar '= '.
In addition every single line should starts with '> '.

In githubmarkdown the definitions are just super complex and we do not follow them. 

	""A block quote marker consists of 0-3 spaces of initial indent, plus (a) the character > together with a following space, or (b) a single character > not followed by a space.""
